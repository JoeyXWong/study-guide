1. Big-O is the analysis of an code block's running time. The running time
is essential to determining the efficiency of the algorithm in how fast it grows.
The faster the runtime grows with the input size the worst the algorithm will running
as the dataset grows larger, even modern computers will crumple with large Big-O algorithms.
